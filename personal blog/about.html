            <!-- About Content -->
            <p>Hi there! My name is <strong>Emia Potocki de Montalk</strong>, and I am 21 years old. I'm French, Romanian, and I have some Polish roots, which is where my last name comes from.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am a full-time student living in Paris, a city that has sparked my love for discovering new places. Traveling is one of my biggest passions, whether I am exploring a new road, a new city, or even a new country or continent.</p>

            <p>For me, every journey is an opportunity to learn, meet new people, and experience different cultures. I’ve always believed that traveling opens your mind and enriches your life in ways that nothing else can. That's why I created this travel diary, to share my adventures and discoveries with you!</p>

            <p>Feel free to follow along as I explore the world, one step at a time!</p>
